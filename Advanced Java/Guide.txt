THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO LEARN IN ADVANCED JAVA IS 
ABOUT KNOWING HOW TO USE THE JAVA OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION.

WHEN THE DEVELOPER KNOWS HOW TO IMPORT THE REQUIRED PACKAGE,
HOW TO SELECT THE CLASS AND MAINLY HOW TO USE THE CLASS METHODS,
CONSTRUCTORS,ETC THEN HE CAN BE FLUENT IN ADVANCED JAVA.

THE TOPICS SUCH AS COLLECTIONS, FILE HANDLING, ETC CAN BE LEARNT AND 
IMPLEMENTED IMMEDIATELY AS PER NEED, THE ONLY REQUIREMENT IS TO BE GOOD AT 
USING THE DOCUMENTATION.
